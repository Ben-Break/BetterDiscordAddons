Thanks to [Niemiets](https://github.com/Niemiets) for the inspiration with their plugin [DashToSpaceInChannelName](https://github.com/Niemiets/BD_Plugins/tree/main/DashToSpaceInChannelName), and [DaSussy](https://github.com/DaSussy) *(great name btw lol)* for the code I based this off. This is basically the first time I've used JavaScript so the code could probably be cleaned, but it does at least work currently
